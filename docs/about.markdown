<img src="/assets/images/yitai-cheng.JPG" width="100"> Hi, My name is Yitai Cheng (程翊泰 in Chinese). I am currently seeking Ph.D. positions in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning related fields. 


I obtained my master's degree from University College London in December 2023. I was supervised by Dr. Laura Toni on my master's research project which focused on neural compression for 360-degree videos. Before that I was an undergraduate student major in Telecommunications Engineering with Management registered in Queen Mary University of London and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
